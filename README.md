# Coffee Machine simulator

Coffee is certainely one of the few things that make the world go round, at least my world! To get to understand OOP and JS Classes a bit better, I set up this charming simulator.

## Prompt

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? Two cups. Press a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voilà, a burst of raw energy is in your hands. But first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on a coffee machine simulator.

This machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, water, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.
